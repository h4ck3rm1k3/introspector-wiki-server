this idea is the capture each instructions data, so given a IP, instruction pointer, we should be able to figure out what it is doing,
using the gdb.

we want to be able to embed the gcc, gdb, libtool, binutils, into icinga, into a new webserver.
basically we want to be able to inspect a program from inside of icinga, it would run a program and extract variables directly from memory.
we can find the addresses of the memory using introspection, tools to intercept data as it is coming in and trace its flow along the program and give meaning to such data.

we basically build up a large database of inputs and output and track them all.
