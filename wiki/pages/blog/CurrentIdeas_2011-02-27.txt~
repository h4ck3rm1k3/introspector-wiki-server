I have started on something practical for the introspector project, a fast web server, in fact a wiki.
The idea is to first make a very fast wiki that can be used for the introspector to host data and programs and serve metadata.
So far I was able to reuse an existing boost proxy server and add in the ability to serve files and give cookies.

Now the question is of patterns in the uri to access introspector data, and what format it should be in.

    * proxy, getting another url
    * file, loading an existing file (permissiong etc)
    * webserver memory, checking out the status of the web server itself
    * session data, 
    * icinga processes
    * compiler processes gcc
    * binutils processes
    * debugger processes gdb
    * svn/git processes
    * automake processes
    * database processes/file data
    * swig

All these things need to be managed via simple urls. we want a system that we can use to bootstrap and load more and more function into. It has to be fast and secure. 

We need to be able to list out and dump any variable in the program as needed.
